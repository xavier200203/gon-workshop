# gon-workshop

## Introduction

In this workshop we will be working with the [ISC721](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-721-nft-transfer) in order to transfer Non-Fungible Token between different testnets(IRISnet,Uptick,Stargaze,Juno and OmniFlix).

This repository contains all the instructions If you want to participate in gon's testing. Please follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete the workshop.

This workshop's primary goal is to better understand the ISC721 nft transfer protocol and how packets are relayed from one chain to another using the IBC primitives.

### What does GoN do
Game of NFTs (GoN) is a program that provides public environments where the Interchain NFT Transfer technology can be extensively tested with community support and innovations can be created pioneeringly.
